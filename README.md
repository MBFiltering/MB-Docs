# MB Smart Wiki

This is a WIP, feedback is welcome

The intent of this wiki is to have a reliable, up-to-date, relevant, consistent and well-formed information source for MB Smart's filtering solutions, to ensure correct information is available to all users.

We want to provide a comprehensive understanding for what goes on under the hood of MB Smart in hopes of having a clear information source to be kept up to date and relevant by us. In the case you believe there is a mistake or there is some information missing, send us a message on slack and we'll evaluate it.
