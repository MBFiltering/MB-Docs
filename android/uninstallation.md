that this only removes the Device Owner from the device and not the app itself, its removal will be
the final step.
- Wait until the device gets a notification stating that removal has been completed, this can take
around 5 minutes.
- You can now attempt to uninstall the MB Smart app, this is best done from _Settings_ => _Apps_ =>
_MB Smart_ and pressing _Uninstall_.
