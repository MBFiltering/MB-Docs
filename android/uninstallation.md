# Android Uninstallation Guide

## Step-by-step instructions

- Cancel the payment on the user's portal, unless the intent is to transfer into a new device.
- On the _Main_ tab of the user's portal, set _Protection_ to "Disabled" and the _On_ switch to 
the "off" position.
- In the section labeled _Remove Filter_ type "Remove" with a capital 'R' and select a reason for
removal, then press the button labeled "Remove".
- Afterwards, press the _Sync_ button on the top portion of the portal, and wait for the portal to
reload. If there was no reload, and the portal showed a message indicating that the device has not
synced, proceed to sync manually on the device by going into the MB Smart app and tapping the button
labeled "Sync" with a cloud (it should be located on the bottom right).
- The device should now receive a notification indicating that removal has started, but take notice
that this only removes the Device Owner from the device and not the app itself, its removal will be
the final step.
- Wait until the device gets a notification stating that removal has been completed, this can take
around 5 minutes.
- You can now attempt to uninstall the MB Smart app, this is best done from _Settings_ => _Apps_ =>
_MB Smart_ and pressing _Uninstall_. Sometimes it will still be greyed out, in which case remove the
_Device Admin_ found in _Settings_ => _Security and Privacy_ => _Other Security Settings_ => _Device
Admin Apps_ where you should be able to disable the MB Smart Admin, allowing to uninstall the app
as stated before.
