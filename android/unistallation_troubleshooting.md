# Android Uninstallation Troubleshooting

- If there was no portal reload after pressing sync, and the portal showed a message indicating that
the device has not synced, proceed to sync manually on the device by going into the MB Smart app and
tapping the button labeled "Sync" with a cloud (it should be located on the bottom right).
- Sometimes the uninstall option will still be greyed out after removing the Device Owner, in which
case remove the _Device Admin_ found in _Settings_ => _Security and Privacy_ => _Other Security 
Settings_ => _Device Admin Apps_ where you should be able to disable the MB Smart Admin, allowing 
to uninstall the app as stated before.
