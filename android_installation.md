# MB Smart Android Installation Guide

## Requirements:
- Android version 5.0 and above
- No other device owner present in the device
- Storage must not be completely full
- Charging port must work (unless the idea is to install via QR code)
- For Android version 14, signing out of all accounts in settings is a prerequisite for installation, this is done by going into *Settings* |> *Passwords and accounts* and removing each one. This will mean that the user needs to sign in to their accounts once again after installation.

## Brand Specific Instructions:

- *Secure Folder* causes issues with installation, where the app is not able to be installed correctly onto the device, thus uninstalling it from settings is necessary before installing the filter by entering into *Secure Folder* |> *Settings* and pressing uninstall.
- *Secondary Users* such as guest user, multiple users or dual messenger will cause the filter installation to fail, so they need to be removed as well.

## Step by Step installation: 
- Go into *Settings* |> *About phone*[^1] |> *Software Information*.
